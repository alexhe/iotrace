# iotrace
iotrace is a tracing tool that can provide information about the I/O behavior
of a program. It builds upon the ptrace interface of the Linux kernel and is
capable of collecting the following statistics:
- The number of times a file was opened/closed/read/written.
- The time spent waiting for open/close/read/write to complete for each file.
- The read/write speed for each file.
- The block sizes read/written for each file.
- The time spent waiting for other syscalls to complete.

[iotrace-GUI](https://github.com/nicolasgross/iotrace-GUI) is a complementary
tool for viewing/filtering/merging the trace results.


iotrace was developed by [Nicolas Gross](https://github.com/nicolasgross) in
the course of a student assistant job at the [HLRS](https://www.hlrs.de) under
[Christoph Niethammer](https://github.com/cniethammer).


## Dependencies
- iotrace currently runs only on 64-bit Linux
- cmake
- pkg-config
- libglib-2.0
- libjson-glib-1.0


## Build
1. Clone repository:
	- `git clone https://github.com/nicolasgross/iotrace`
2. Create build directory and `cd` into it:
	- `mkdir YOUR_BUILD_DIR`
	- `cd YOUR_BUILD_DIR`
3. Build iotrace:
	- `cmake PATH_TO_CLONED_REPOSITORY`
	- `make iotrace`
4. Done, there should be an executable called `iotrace` in the build directory.


## Usage
- `[IOTRACE_OPTIONS]`: Options for iotrace.
- `TRACE_ID`: The ID for this trace, choose one. (String)
- `YOUR_PROGRAM`: The program that should be traced.
- `[YOUR_PROGRAM_ARGUMENTS]`: The arguments for the program that should be traced.
- `[MPIRUN_ARGUMENTS]`: The arguments for `mpirun`.

#### Trace normal program
`iotrace [IOTRACE_OPTIONS] TRACE_ID YOUR_PROGRAM [YOUR_PROGRAM_ARGUMENTS]`

#### Trace MPI program
`mpirun [MPIRUN_ARGUMENTS] iotrace [IOTRACE_OPTIONS] TRACE_ID YOUR_PROGRAM [YOUR_PROGRAM_ARGUMENTS]`


#### Options
You can use the `-v` or `--verbose` flag to print the trace results also to the
command line.


## Output
iotrace generates JSON files, which contain the results of the trace. They are
named in the scheme `TRACE-ID_HOSTNAME_RANK.json` and can be
viewed/filtered/merged with
[iotrace-GUI](https://github.com/nicolasgross/iotrace-GUI).

The output files are formatted as follows:
- open : [ 'count', 'total nanosecs', 'min nanosecs', 'max nanosecs' ]
- close : [ 'count', 'total nanosecs', 'min nanosecs', 'max nanosecs' ]
- read : [ 'total bytes', 'total nanosecs', 'min byte/sec', 'max byte/sec' ]
- read-blocks : [ [ 'number of bytes', 'count' ], ... ]
- write : [ 'total bytes', 'total nanosecs', 'min byte/sec', 'max byte/sec' ]
- write-blocks : [ [ 'number of bytes', 'count' ], ... ]
